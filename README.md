Tour Guide
This is the 6th app in my journey of learning Android Development. Tour guide app is kind of Guiding or helping app for a Tourist in Egypt. It previews Egypt's capital and rest of Towns in it, the most exciting sights in each town, the important and funniest events, and a Recommendation to a magnificent place in egypt to visit.

I have used in this app:

* ViewPager to navigate within the app tabs.
* ListView to preview the data in each Fragment.
* Custom Adapter to carry Layout & Views.
* Custom object for storing (Location Info).
